# Planet Killer Simulator 🌍💥

A Python-based meteor impact simulator that calculates and visualizes the destructive effects of asteroid/comet strikes on major Earth cities.

## Features

- **Customizable Meteor Parameters**: Specify diameter, velocity, and material composition
- **Multiple Material Types**: Choose from Iron, Stone, Ice, and Nickel-Iron asteroids
- **Major Cities Database**: Target 20+ major world cities
- **Physics-Based Calculations**: Accurate impact energy and destruction zone calculations
- **Visual Impact Maps**: ASCII-based visualization of destruction zones
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare impact energy to historical events (Hiroshima, Tunguska, etc.)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/squiddonaut/PlanetKillerSimulator.git
cd PlanetKillerSimulator

# No external dependencies required - uses Python standard library only!
```

## Usage

### Running the Simulator

```bash
python simulator.py
```

### Interactive Mode

The simulator will guide you through:

1. **Meteor Parameters**:
   - Diameter (in meters, e.g., 10-1000m)
   - Impact velocity (in m/s, typical range: 11,000-72,000 m/s)
   - Material type (Iron, Stone, Ice, Nickel-Iron)

2. **Target Selection**:
   - Choose from 20+ major world cities
   - Includes cities like New York, Tokyo, London, Paris, etc.

3. **Results**:
   - Kinetic energy calculation
   - TNT equivalent
   - Crater diameter estimation
   - Destruction zone radii
   - ASCII visualization map
   - Comparisons to historical events

### Example Session

```
METEOR PARAMETERS:
Enter meteor diameter in meters (e.g., 10-1000): 50
Enter impact velocity in m/s (typical: 11,000-72,000): 20000

Select material: Iron

Select target city: New York

IMPACT ANALYSIS:
  Kinetic Energy:  3.24e+16 Joules
  TNT Equivalent:  7,751.20 kilotons
  Crater Diameter: 1,234.5 meters
  
DESTRUCTION ZONES:
  Fireball Radius:         0.89 km
  Total Destruction:       2.20 km
  Severe Damage:           4.41 km
  Moderate Damage:         8.82 km
  Light Damage:            17.64 km
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to validate physics calculations:

```bash
python -m unittest test_simulator.py
```

Or run with verbose output:

```bash
python -m unittest test_simulator.py -v
```

## Physics Model

The simulator uses simplified but physics-based models:

### Mass Calculation
```
Volume = (4/3) × π × r³
Mass = Volume × Density
```

### Kinetic Energy
```
KE = 0.5 × Mass × Velocity²
```

### Crater Formation
Based on empirical scaling laws from impact crater studies.

### Destruction Zones
Calculated using energy scaling similar to nuclear weapon effects, adapted for meteor impacts.

## Material Properties

| Material    | Density (kg/m³) | Description              |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Iron        | 7,870           | Dense metallic asteroid  |
| Stone       | 3,300           | Rocky asteroid           |
| Ice         | 917             | Icy comet                |
| Nickel-Iron | 8,000           | Dense metallic asteroid  |

## Available Cities

The simulator includes 20 major world cities across all continents:
- **Americas**: New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, São Paulo, Buenos Aires
- **Europe**: London, Paris, Moscow, Berlin, Istanbul
- **Asia**: Tokyo, Beijing, Mumbai, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai
- **Middle East/Africa**: Cairo
- **Oceania**: Sydney

## Limitations

- Simplified atmospheric entry effects (no fragmentation modeling)
- Does not account for impact angle
- Simplified crater formation models
- Does not model seismic effects or tsunamis
- Destruction zones are approximations based on energy scaling

## Educational Purpose

This simulator is designed for educational purposes to understand the physics of meteor impacts. The calculations are based on simplified models and should not be used for actual hazard assessment.

## License

This project is open source and available for educational use.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the simulator.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is a simulation for educational purposes only.** The results are approximations based on simplified physics models. Do not use this for actual impact hazard assessment or emergency planning.

**Remember**: While meteor impacts are a real concern, the probability of a large impact in any given year is extremely low. NASA and other space agencies actively track near-Earth objects to provide early warning of potential threats.
